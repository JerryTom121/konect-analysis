This is the KONECT analysis component (KONECT-Analysis).  It allows to run
analyses of KONECT networks in parallel. 

== Requirements ==

* Stu:  install from https://github.com/kunegis/stu
* g++
* python-rdflib (for RDF generation only)
* sed -r (this is non-POSIX)

== Prepare ==

* Mount, link, symlink or copy uni/ into this directory.  The uni/
  directory must be present and contain all out.* and meta.* files.   
* Mount, link, symlink or copy the dat/ and plot/ directories/ here.
* (optional) Install libraries as described in lib/README.  Not all
  targets need extra libraries.  You may as well don't do it and wait
  until you get a corresponding error message. 
* Symlink (or copy) to ./konect-toolbox a version of the KONECT Toolbox
  available at  https://github.com/kunegis/konect-toolbox

== Run ==

* Execute "./mns", which calls Stu; see main.stu for targets.

Output is written to dat/ (data files) and plot/ (plots).
