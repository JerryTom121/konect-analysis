These are C programs used in KONECT-Analysis.  These are much
faster and use much less memory than Matlab, but are also more complex.  

Each standalone program is a *.c file.  Libraries are simply *.h files.
We always compile *.c files in a single step, without using *.o files.

The compiled files are in bin/.

We use the C99 standard.

Programs use custom bit widths per dataset; see width.h for an overview.
